## Real Time Chat with React, GraphQL, and AWS AppSync

This project uses the CDK and [cdk-appsync-transformer](https://github.com/kcwinner/cdk-appsync-transformer) to utilize the best 
parts of Amplify (autogenerated tables, resolvers, types, and graphql operations from a schema) while keeping the flexibility and 
declarative style of the CDK.
